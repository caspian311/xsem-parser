i'm terrible at ruby.  i just wanted to start a project that seemed useful at 
the time.  so that's all this is.

there needs to be a database created named bible_test for the tests to run.  the 
sql for the tables in that database is found in db.sql.  i think there are too 
many columns in some of the tables.  i'll fix it someday... maybe...
